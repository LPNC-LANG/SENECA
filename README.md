Code Repo for the article **"Modeling the Neurocognitive Dynamics of Language across the Lifespan"**

***Highlights***

•	Lexical production (LP) relies on the interplay between domain-general and semanticprocesses throughout life.

•	DMN (Default Mode Network) suppression cooperates with FPN (Fronto-ParietalNetwork) integration to maintain LP performance at a minimal cost.

•	Midlife marks a neurocognitive shift, with reduced DMN suppression prompting a morecost-efficient compensatory strategy that prioritizes homeostasis over LP performance.
